            <h2>Events</h2>
            <p>
                We hold three types of events during the year, open weaves, workshops, and our annual retreat "Weaving Connections‚Äù.
            </p>
            <p>
                Open weaves do not have an instructor present and are free to attend. You can bring your own materials or coordinate with the host beforehand, and they can provide you with materials for a small gathering fee. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Workshops are led by experienced instructors, and materials are included in the price. Most workshops range between $65 (half day) to $250 (several days). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Weaving Connections is a 3-day retreat held in March at Aspen Ridge Greenhouse in Sherwood Park, workshops are offered throughout the weekend.
