<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>Our suggested membership fee is $50. This fee allows us to sustain our community activities and benefits. If this fee is not within your means, please only pay what you can afford. Or, if you can afford a little more, then help us cover the members who can't. Every dollar makes a difference.</p>
